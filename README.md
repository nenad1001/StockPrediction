# StockPrediction
Use of machine learning algorithms to predict stock price based on article news

We are using naive bayes classifier and Yahoo API to predict whether is stock going to rise or fall in the following few hours. Stay tuned for implementation of a neural network instead of the naive bayes classifier.

Feel free to make pull request.
